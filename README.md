# Language-features

What language-features do we want to see in PHP.

**WE** in this case are the people using the language - be it on a day-to-day base or sporadic - not those creating the language. There might be people that fall in both categories though ;-) 

## **A word of caution!**

**This is not an official site of the PHP-Community but just a side-project of a geek!**

If you would like to see a specific language feature implemented in [PHP](http://php.net), [open an issue](https://github.com/whatdowewant4php/languagefeatures/issues/new), describe it and see what the rest of the community thinks about it. 

That way those doing the actual implementations can get an objective feeling (is there such a thing?) of what users would like to see in the language of their choice!
